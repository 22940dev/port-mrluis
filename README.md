## About

This is my first Portfolio as **Web Developer** | **Frontend**, I built it with the basic Frontend tools like `HTML`,` CSS` and `Javascript`

But it was using `React` to speed up the development and` TypesScript` for pleasure and avoid errors that happen in the future or when it is in production

I know there is a lot of code that can improve or decrease, so what I find or when I know and learn best practices I will improve and add features to the project later

<br />

### Scripts Disponibles

This will start the project locally on your `localhost: 3000`
